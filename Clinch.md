# The model driven approach
## the plan
I happened to work for a project of the Clinch* company that had (maybe still has) the following plan:
-   develop software for a digital interlocking (DSTW) from the scratch
-   development should be model based
-   use the IMB* toolchain including the Raggedy* modeling tool

## SIL4
A DSTW software has to meet the standards of SIL4 / EN 50 129.

Security Integrity Level 4 requires following some rules, e.g.:

Before code can be checked in into a main branch it has to
-   be peer reviewed.
-   be (module) tested successfully with a 100% code coverage
-   follow special coding guidelines (static code analysis, SCA)

Any check in / merge must be blocked before continuous integration has been passed successfully:
-   build
-   tests
-   coverage
-   SCA

## IMB toolchain
The IMB toolchain consists of 4 (four) so called managements that hardly collaborate with each other.

What the tools don’t provide is:
-   a working source control
-   a working review facility
-   a continuous integration
-   an understandable documentation
-   a community

What they provide is:
-   the permanent need of workarounds and repetitive click surface work down
-   a great collection of pitfalls and error driven frustration
-   permanent dysfunction
-   a high demand on support by doubtful specialists
-   repetitive "hm, last time it worked" in so called trainings
-   crappy C-code in bits and pieces
-   90 % of the effort spent for the tools and not for work to be done

In other words: there is no way to reach SIL4 using the IMB toolchain.

## the result
If a company’s philosophy is never to report any problems, it ends up exactly like Clinch:
-   increasing demand of human resources without any improvement / acceleration of work done
-   increasing frustration of the ones that need to get the work done
-   a complete illusory estimation of progress by the management
